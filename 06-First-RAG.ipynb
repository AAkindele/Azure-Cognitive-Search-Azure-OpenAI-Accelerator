Now, when we need to perform a calculation, the Agent can call in the expert rather than trying to predict the result itself.

       "One application of Markov chains in medicine is in the prediction of transient particle transport in enclosed environments to understand the airborne infectious disease transmission risk to occupants. A combined computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and Markov chain method has been developed to predict transient particle transport in such environments. This method first calculates a transition probability matrix using CFD simulations and then applies the Markov chain technique to calculate the transient particle concentration distributions. This approach provides faster-than-real-time information about particle transport and can be used to avoid the recalculation of the particle transport equation when the source location is changed, thus reducing computing costs<sup><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/ina.12056\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a></sup>.\n",
       "\n",
       "Another application is in the modeling of the spread of viruses using a Spatial Markov Chain model. This model represents a graph connecting nodes, which represent humans, and the likelihood of infectious spread from person to person is determined by the intensity of interpersonal contact. The model incorporates various lockdown scenarios and provides insights into the spread of infectious diseases<sup><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05635v1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">[2]</a></sup>.\n",

       "The spread of viruses involves various mechanisms at the molecular, cellular, and population levels. When viruses enter the body, they can spread locally on body surfaces or through the lymphatic and blood vessels to produce systemic infection. The initial attachment and infection of cells occur on body surfaces such as the skin, mucosa of the digestive, respiratory, or urogenital tract, or the conjunctiva. Additionally, parenteral injection, either by needle or arthropod/vertebrate bites, can bypass body surfaces and lead to infection. The spread of viruses can also occur through the animal via the lymphatics, blood vessels, or nerves<sup><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7173411/?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-01-03T02:11:44Z&st=2024-01-02T18:11:44Z&spr=https&sig=ngrEqvqBVaxyuSYqgPVeF%2B9c0fXLs94v3ASgwg7LDBs%3D\">1</a></sup>.\n",
