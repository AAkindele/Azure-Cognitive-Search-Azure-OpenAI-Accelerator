    "- **Notebook 01**: We loaded the Azure Search Engine with enriched PDFs in index: \"cogsrch-index-files\"\n",
    "- **Notebook 02**: We loaded more information to the Search Engine this time using a CSV file with 90k rows/articles in index: \"cogsrch-index-csv\"\n",
    "- **Notebook 03**: We added AzureOpenAI GPT models to enhance the the production of the answer by using Utility Chains of LLMs\n",
    "- **Notebook 04**: We manually loaded an index with large/complex PDFs information , \"cogsrch-index-books-vector\"\n",
    "- **Notebook 05**: We added memory to our system in order to power a conversational Chat Bot\n",
    "- **Notebook 06**: We introduced Agents and Tools and built the first Skill/Agent, that can do RAG over a search engine\n",
    "- **Notebook 07**: We build a second Agent (Pandas) in order to be able to solve a more complex task: ask questions to Tabular datasets\n",
    "- **Notebook 08**: We used a SQL Agent in order to talk to a SQL Database directly\n",
    "- **Notebook 09**: We used another  Agent in order to talk to the Bing Search API and create a Bing Chat Clone and implemented callbacks for real-time streaming and tool information\n",
    "- **Notebook 10**: We built an API Agent that can translate a question into the right API calls, giving us the capability to talk to any datasource that provides a RESTFul API.\n",

    "We want a virtual assistant for our company that can get the question, think what tool to use, then get the answer. The goal is that, regardless of the source of the information (Search Engine, Bing Search, SQL Database, CSV File, JSON File, APIs, etc), the Assistant can answer the question correctly using the right tool.\n",

    "1) understands the question, interacts with the user \n",

       "\n",
       "1. **Increased Severity**: Studies indicate that obesity is highly frequent among critically ill patients with COVID-19, and it remains challenging to elucidate the exact mechanisms by which the severity of COVID-19 is increased in the context of obesity<sup><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.22867\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a></sup>.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Cardiac Complications**: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19, especially those with obesity, are more likely to present cardiac complications, including myocarditis, arrhythmias, heart failure, and sudden death<sup><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.22867\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a></sup>.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Risk of Severe Disease**: Obese patients with COVID-19 have increased odds of progressing to severe illness. They are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms and complications compared to patients with normal weight<sup><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2337/dc20-0576\" target=\"_blank\">[2]</a></sup>.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Impact on In-Hospital Mortality**: The myocardial response in COVID-19 is closely associated with in-hospital mortality, and the local biological effects on myocardial tissue from epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) warrant further discussion<sup><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.22867\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a></sup>.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Global Impact**: The impact of obesity in seriously ill COVID-19 patients is evident, with a significant percentage of patients in critical care units being either overweight or obese<sup><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.22844\" target=\"_blank\">[3]</a></sup>.\n",

       "\n",
       "3. **Risk Interactions Across Age Groups**: The risk of coronavirus infection among elderly people is significantly affected by other age groups, and protecting elderly people from infection could reduce the risk of infection among themselves and other age groups<sup><a href=\"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.17.20105049v1\" target=\"_blank\">[6]</a></sup>.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Complications and Severity**: Complications of COVID-19 have been particularly severe among older adults, emphasizing the need for pandemic preparedness and support programs for this demographic<sup><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.139292\" target=\"_blank\">[7]</a></sup>.\n",

       "The \"Kidney Heist\" legend is a well-known urban legend that has circulated widely over the past fifteen years. The legend typically begins with the classic urban-legend opening: \"A friend of a friend...\" and involves a story about a person who wakes up in an ice-filled bathtub, having been drugged and had one of their kidneys stolen. There are numerous versions of this legend, but they all share a core of three elements: (1) the drugged drink, (2) the ice-filled bathtub, and (3) the kidney-theft punch line. The details of the story often include specific locations, which vary when the legend is told in different parts of the country. The legend is characterized by its vivid and concrete details, making it memorable and easy to retell. It is a story that sticks, as people understand it, remember it, and can retell it later. If believed to be true, it might change behavior, such as being cautious about accepting drinks from strangers.\n",
       "\n",
       "The legend's stickiness can be attributed to its concrete and memorable nature, as well as its ability to tap into emotions such as fear, disgust, and suspicion. The legend's widespread circulation and retention can be compared to other successful urban legends and stories that share similar traits of memorability and stickiness.\n",
       "\n",
       "The \"Kidney Heist\" legend is an example of how concrete details make an idea seem more real and believable, lending credibility to the idea itself. It is a story that has persisted and circulated widely, despite having no resources to support it, and it continues to be retold with localized details that enhance its credibility and effect.\n",
       "\n",
       "For more details and insights into the \"Kidney Heist\" legend and the characteristics of sticky ideas, you can refer to the book \"Made to Stick\" by Chip Heath and Dan Heath, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the factors that make ideas memorable and effective in changing thought or behavior<sup><a href=\"https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/books/Made_To_Stick.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-01-03T02:11:44Z&st=2024-01-02T18:11:44Z&spr=https&sig=ngrEqvqBVaxyuSYqgPVeF%2B9c0fXLs94v3ASgwg7LDBs%3D\">source</a></sup>."

It involves the parametrization of a logic programming language with respect to a constraint language and a domain of computation, yielding soundness and completeness results for an operational semantics relying on a constraint solver for the employed constraint language.

The goal is to find solutions to a CLP(FD) program by using propagation and enumeration mechanisms. The translation of an imperative program into a constraint logic programming on finite domains (CLP(FD)) involves generating a CLP(FD) constraint between the input and output variables of an imperative program.

The name CLP was first introduced by Jaffar and Lassez in 1986 for a general framework of a logic programming language that is parameterized with respect to constraint language and a domain of computation. This framework yields soundness and completeness results for an operational semantics relying on a constraint solver for the employed constraint language.\n",

       "CLP provides an operational treatment of various frameworks by embedding arbitrary logical languages into constraint logic programs. It defines grammars as constraint logic programs, i.e., as sets of axiomatic interpreted definite clauses. The prediction problem in this setting involves inferring an answer proving the implication to be a logical consequence of the program.\n",

       "1. **Developmental Aspect of Boundaries**: It's important to understand that boundaries come after bonding in the developmental process. Children must have secure bonding before they can effectively learn boundaries. Good connections naturally lead children to set boundaries and gain independence.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Instilling vs. Repairing Boundaries**: Teaching responsibility, limit setting, and delay of gratification early on can make children's later years of life smoother. Developing boundaries in young children is like an ounce of prevention, while boundary development in older children may be met with more resistance, requiring more time and support.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Boundary Development in Children**: The work of boundary development in children is described as the work of learning responsibility. It involves teaching them the merits and limits of responsibility, which in turn prepares them to take on the tasks of adulthood.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Teaching Responsibility**: Successful parenting means that children want to be responsible and caring because it's important to them, not just because it's important to their parents.\n",
       "\n",
       "These insights provide a comprehensive understanding of the importance of setting boundaries with kids and the developmental aspects involved in this process. If you need further information or have any other questions, feel free to ask!"
