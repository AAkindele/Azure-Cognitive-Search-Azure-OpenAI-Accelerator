    "\n",
    "- **Notebook 01**: We loaded the Azure Search Engine with enriched PDFs in index: \"cogsrch-index-files\"\n",
    "- **Notebook 02**: We loaded more information to the Search Engine this time using a CSV file with 90k rows/articles in index: \"cogsrch-index-csv\"\n",
    "- **Notebook 03**: We added AzureOpenAI GPT models to enhance the the production of the answer by using Utility Chains of LLMs\n",
    "- **Notebook 04**: We manually loaded an index with large/complex PDFs information , \"cogsrch-index-books-vector\"\n",
    "- **Notebook 05**: We added memory to our system in order to power a conversational Chat Bot\n",
    "- **Notebook 06**: We introduced Agents and Tools and built the first Skill/Agent, that can do RAG over a search engine\n",
    "- **Notebook 07**: We build a second Agent (Pandas) in order to be able to solve a more complex task: ask questions to Tabular datasets\n",
    "- **Notebook 08**: We used a SQL Agent in order to talk to a SQL Database directly\n",
    "- **Notebook 09**: We used another  Agent in order to talk to the Bing Search API and create a Bing Chat Clone and implemented callbacks for real-time streaming and tool information\n",
    "- **Notebook 10**: We built an API Agent that can translate a question into the right API calls, giving us the capability to talk to any datasource that provides a RESTFul API.\n",

    "We are missing one more thing: **How do we glue all these features together into a very smart GPT Smart Search Engine Chat Bot?**\n",

    "We want a virtual assistant for our company that can get the question, think what tool to use, then get the answer. The goal is that, regardless of the source of the information (Search Engine, Bing Search, SQL Database, CSV File, JSON File, APIs, etc), the Assistant can answer the question correctly using the right tool.\n",

       "Obesity is a significant risk factor for severe illness and complications related to COVID-19. Here are some key findings from the retrieved documents:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Increased Severity**: Studies have shown that obesity is highly frequent among critically ill patients with COVID-19, and it remains difficult to elucidate the mechanisms by which COVID-19 severity is increased in the context of obesity<sup><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.22867\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a></sup>.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Cardiac Complications**: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who are obese are more likely to present cardiac complications, including myocarditis, arrhythmias, heart failure, and sudden death<sup><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.22867\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a></sup>.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Risk of Severe Disease**: Obese patients with COVID-19 have increased odds of progressing to severe illness, and they tend to have symptoms such as cough and fever compared to non-obese patients<sup><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2337/dc20-0576\" target=\"_blank\">[2]</a></sup>.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Impact on Mortality**: Two-thirds of people who developed serious or fatal COVID-19-related complications were overweight or obese, indicating the impact of obesity in seriously ill COVID-19 patients<sup><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.22844\" target=\"_blank\">[3]</a></sup>.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Mechanistic Framework**: Adipose tissue in subjects with obesity may act as a reservoir for more extensive viral spread with increased shedding, immune activation, and cytokine amplification, leading to poor COVID-19 outcomes<sup><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32377709/\" target=\"_blank\">[4]</a></sup>.\n",

       "Elderly people are at a higher risk of more serious and possibly fatal illness associated with COVID-19. Here are some key findings from the retrieved documents:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Mortality Risk**: The risk of mortality due to COVID-19 increases with age, with higher mortality rates observed in people in their 60s, 70s, and over 80s<sup><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32239784/\" target=\"_blank\">[5]</a></sup>.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Severity and Incidence**: The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is affecting elderly people worldwide with greater incidence and severity, with a significant proportion of coronavirus hospitalizations corresponding to those over 60 years of age<sup><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425485/\" target=\"_blank\">[6]</a></sup>.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Risk Interactions Across Age Groups**: The risk of coronavirus infection among elderly people is significantly affected by other age groups, and protecting elderly people from coronavirus infection could reduce the risk of infection among themselves and other age groups<sup><a href=\"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.17.20105049v1\" target=\"_blank\">[7]</a></sup>.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Complications**: Complications of COVID-19 have been particularly severe among older adults, emphasizing the need for pandemic preparedness in nursing homes and support programs for community-dwelling older adults<sup><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32302293/\" target=\"_blank\">[8]</a></sup>.\n",

       "The \"Kidney Heist\" legend is a well-known urban legend that has circulated widely over the past fifteen years. The legend typically begins with the classic urban-legend opening: \"A friend of a friend...\" and involves a story about a person who wakes up in an ice-filled bathtub after being drugged, only to discover that one of their kidneys has been stolen. There are numerous versions of this legend, but they all share the core elements of the drugged drink, the ice-filled bathtub, and the kidney-theft punch line. The story is often set in a specific location, which varies depending on where it is told, adding localized details that lend credibility to the tale<sup><a href=\"https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/books/Made_To_Stick.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-01-03T02:11:44Z&st=2024-01-02T18:11:44Z&spr=https&sig=ngrEqvqBVaxyuSYqgPVeF%2B9c0fXLs94v3ASgwg7LDBs%3D\">source</a></sup>.\n",

       "The legend is characterized by its unexpected outcome, concrete details, and emotional impact, making it memorable and easily retold.

The name CLP was first introduced by Jaffar and Lassez in 1986 for a general framework of a logic programming language that is parameterized with respect to constraint language and a domain of computation. This framework yields soundness and completeness results for an operational semantics relying on a constraint solver for the employed constraint language.\n",

Definite clause specifications over such constraint languages then define grammars as constraint logic programs, i.e., as sets of axiomatic interpreted definite clauses. The work on Constraint Logic Programming has also been extended to include constraint logic grammars, which express the connection between CLP and constraint-based grammars. CLGs are understood as grammars formulated by means of a suitable logical language, which can be used as a constraint language in the CLP scheme.\n",

       "\n",
       "1. **Importance of Bonding Before Boundaries**: The document emphasizes that boundaries come after bonding. Children must have secure bonding before they can effectively learn to set boundaries and gain independence. Good connections naturally lead to the development of boundaries and the ability to move away from others.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Instilling vs. Repairing Boundaries**: Early instilling of responsibility, limit setting, and delay of gratification in young children can lead to smoother later years of life. However, for parents of older children, boundary development may be met with more resistance, requiring more time and support from friends.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Boundary Development in Children**: The work of boundary development in children is the work of learning responsibility. Teaching children the merits and limits of responsibility prepares them to take on the tasks of adulthood.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Teaching Responsibility**: The document provides an example of how a child learned to take responsibility for himself through a slow transfer of qualities from the outside to the inside. Boundaries facilitated the process of having the child internalize things that were external to him.\n",
       "\n",
       "These insights offer valuable guidance on the importance of setting boundaries with children and the developmental aspects associated with this process<sup><a href=\"https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/books/Boundaries_When_to_Say_Yes_How_to_Say_No_to_Take_Control_of_Your_Life.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-01-03T02:11:44Z&st=2024-01-02T18:11:44Z&spr=https&sig=ngrEqvqBVaxyuSYqgPVeF%2B9c0fXLs94v3ASgwg7LDBs%3D\" target=\"_blank\">source</a></sup>."
