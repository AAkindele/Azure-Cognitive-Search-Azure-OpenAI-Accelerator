    "These are the pros and cons of using the Bot Service:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**:\n",
    "- Easy to connect to multiple channels, including O365 emails, MS Teams, web chat plugging, etc.\n",
    "- The Bot Framework python SDKs give us a lot of utilities like Typing indicator, pro-active messages, cards, file upload, etc. \n",
    "- Provides Authentication and logging mechanism without us to do much work\n",
    "- As other Microsoft Service, you get Microsoft product team and support teams behind it\n",
    "- It has SDKs for Python, JavaScript and .NET\n",
    "- Includes easy connection with Application Insights Service for app monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**:\n",
    "- It doesn't support streaming (yet)\n",
    "- Has a steeper learning curve to learn all its capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So, as an alternative, in this Notebook we are going to build another Backend API, this time using FastAPI with LangServe.\n",
    "From the [LANGSERVE DOCUMENTATION](https://python.langchain.com/docs/langserve):\n",
    "\n",
    "    LangServe helps developers deploy LangChain runnables and chains as a REST API.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This library is integrated with FastAPI and uses pydantic for data validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In addition, it provides a client that can be used to call into runnables deployed on a server. A JavaScript client is available in LangChain.js."

      "1. **Constraint Logic Programming (CLP)**: CLP is an extension of logic programming that involves the incorporation of constraint languages and constraint-solving methods into logic programming languages. In CLP programs, logical variables are assigned a domain, and relations between variables are described with constraints. A solution to a CLP program is a valuation of every variable in its own domain such that no constraint is falsified. Solutions are found using mechanisms such as propagation and enumeration<sup><a href=\"https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/arxivcs/pdf/0508/0508108v1.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-01-03T02:11:44Z&st=2024-01-02T18:11:44Z&spr=https&sig=ngrEqvqBVaxyuSYqgPVeF%2B9c0fXLs94v3ASgwg7LDBs%3D\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a></sup>.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Core-Like Particles (CLP)**: In a biological context, CLP refers to core-like particles, which are virus or virus-like particles. For example, the document mentions the quantification of recombinant baculovirus-generated bluetongue virus (BTV) core-like particles (CLP) using immunosorbent electron microscopy<sup><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10403670/?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-01-03T02:11:44Z&st=2024-01-02T18:11:44Z&spr=https&sig=ngrEqvqBVaxyuSYqgPVeF%2B9c0fXLs94v3ASgwg7LDBs%3D\" target=\"_blank\">[2]</a></sup>.\n",

      "1. Fatigue: This is one of the most common symptoms and can be severe and debilitating.\n",

      "- Persistent viral reservoirs: Some researchers suggest that remnants of the virus may remain in the body, causing ongoing symptoms.\n",
      "- Immune response: An overactive or dysregulated immune response may lead to inflammation and the symptoms associated with Long COVID.\n",
      "- Vascular damage: COVID-19 can cause damage to blood vessels, which may lead to long-term complications.\n",
      "- Autonomic nervous system dysfunction: Disruption in the system that controls involuntary body functions, such as heart rate and digestion, might contribute to symptoms.\n",

      "Diagnosis of Long COVID is primarily based on the patient's history and symptoms, as there is no specific test for it. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive, with the aim of managing and alleviating symptoms. This can include physical therapy, medication for symptom relief, and cognitive rehabilitation for brain fog, among other interventions.\n",
