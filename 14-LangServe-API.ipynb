    "These are the pros and cons of using the Bot Service:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**:\n",
    "- Easy to connect to multiple channels, including O365 emails, MS Teams, web chat plugging, etc.\n",
    "- The Bot Framework python SDKs give us a lot of utilities like Typing indicator, pro-active messages, cards, file upload, etc. \n",
    "- Provides Authentication and logging mechanism without us to do much work\n",
    "- It has SDKs for Python, JavaScript and .NET\n",
    "- Includes easy connection with Application Insights Service for app monitoring\n",
    "- As other Microsoft services, you get Microsoft product team and support teams behind it\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**:\n",
    "- It doesn't support streaming (yet)\n",
    "- It doesn't support private endpoint\n",
    "- Has a steeper learning curve to learn all its capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So, as an alternative, in this Notebook we are going to build another Backend API in the same Azure App Service, this time using FastAPI with LangServe.<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "    LangServe helps developers deploy LangChain runnables and chains as a REST API.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This library is integrated with FastAPI and uses pydantic for data validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In addition, it provides a client that can be used to call into runnables deployed on a server. A JavaScript client is available in LangChain.js."

      "1. **Increased Risk of Severe COVID-19**: Obese patients have a significantly higher risk of progressing to severe COVID-19, with men who are obese having even higher odds of developing severe disease.\n",
      "2. **Impact on Critical Care Units**: A large proportion of patients in critical care units were either overweight or obese, indicating a substantial impact of obesity in seriously ill COVID-19 patients.\n",
      "3. **Mechanistic Framework**: Adipose tissue in individuals with obesity may contribute to more extensive viral spread, immune activation, and cytokine amplification, leading to a more severe outcome for obese individuals with COVID-19.\n",
      "4. **Clinical Guidelines and Recommendations**: Clinical guidelines and recommendations have been outlined to provide community nurses with up-to-date information required for protecting individuals living with obesity and other long-term conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Elderly and COVID-19\n",
      "1. **Severity and Mortality**: Elderly patients with COVID-19 are more likely to experience severe disease and have a higher mortality rate compared to younger patients.\n",
      "2. **Clinical Characteristics**: Elderly patients with COVID-19 may present with higher PSI scores, indicating a more severe illness, and a higher proportion of patients with multiple lobe involvement.\n",
      "3. **Risk of Infection**: The risk of coronavirus infection among elderly people is significantly affected by other age groups, with an increase in virus infection among people aged 20-39 doubling the risk of infection among elderly people.\n",
      "4. **Public Policy and Preparedness**: Public policy goals should prioritize pandemic preparedness in nursing homes and support programs for community-dwelling older adults to mitigate the risk of infection while promoting wellness during a period of stress and uncertainty.\n",
      "5. **Impact on Elder Mistreatment**: The COVID-19 outbreak has had a profound impact on organizations that typically respond to protect and serve victims of elder mistreatment, requiring creative solutions and lessons learned to address the unique challenges faced by older adults during the pandemic.\n",

It provides a framework for a logic programming language that is parametrized with respect to constraint language and a domain of computation, yielding soundness and completeness results for an operational semantics relying on a constraint solver for the employed constraint language<sup><a href=\"https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/arxivcs/pdf/0008/0008036v1.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-01-03T02:11:44Z&st=2024-01-02T18:11:44Z&spr=https&sig=ngrEqvqBVaxyuSYqgPVeF%2B9c0fXLs94v3ASgwg7LDBs%3D\">source</a></sup>.\\n\\n2. **Constraint Logic Programming over Finite Domains (CLP(FD)):** This is an extension of logic programming where logical variables are assigned a domain and relations between variables are described with constraints. It provides primitives for accessing and updating attribute values, as well as constraints such as equality, disequality, and inequality constraints. It also includes constraint propagation mechanisms for maintaining the consistency of constraints<sup><a href=\"https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/arxivcs/pdf/0506/0506005v1.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-01-03T02:11:44Z&st=2024-01-02T18:11:44Z&spr=https&sig=ngrEqvqBVaxyuSYqgPVeF%2B9c0fXLs94v3ASgwg7LDBs%3D\">source</a></sup>.\\n\\n3. **Recurrence with Affine Level Mappings in CLP(R):** This reference discusses a class of constraint logic programs such that their termination can be proved by using affine level mappings.

It provides a framework for a logic programming language that is parametrized with respect to constraint language and a domain of computation, yielding soundness and completeness results for an operational semantics relying on a constraint solver for the employed constraint language<sup><a href=\"https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/arxivcs/pdf/0008/0008036v1.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-01-03T02:11:44Z&st=2024-01-02T18:11:44Z&spr=https&sig=ngrEqvqBVaxyuSYqgPVeF%2B9c0fXLs94v3ASgwg7LDBs%3D\">source</a></sup>.\\n\\n2. **Constraint Logic Programming over Finite Domains (CLP(FD)):** This is an extension of logic programming where logical variables are assigned a domain and relations between variables are described with constraints. It provides primitives for accessing and updating attribute values, as well as constraints such as equality, disequality, and inequality constraints. It also includes constraint propagation mechanisms for maintaining the consistency of constraints<sup><a href=\"https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/arxivcs/pdf/0506/0506005v1.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-01-03T02:11:44Z&st=2024-01-02T18:11:44Z&spr=https&sig=ngrEqvqBVaxyuSYqgPVeF%2B9c0fXLs94v3ASgwg7LDBs%3D\">source</a></sup>.\\n\\n3. **Recurrence with Affine Level Mappings in CLP(R):** This reference discusses a class of constraint logic programs such that their termination can be proved by using affine level mappings.

It provides a framework for a logic programming language that is parametrized with respect to constraint language and a domain of computation, yielding soundness and completeness results for an operational semantics relying on a constraint solver for the employed constraint language<sup><a href=\"https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/arxivcs/pdf/0008/0008036v1.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-01-03T02:11:44Z&st=2024-01-02T18:11:44Z&spr=https&sig=ngrEqvqBVaxyuSYqgPVeF%2B9c0fXLs94v3ASgwg7LDBs%3D\">source</a></sup>.\\n\\n2. **Constraint Logic Programming over Finite Domains (CLP(FD)):** This is an extension of logic programming where logical variables are assigned a domain and relations between variables are described with constraints. It provides primitives for accessing and updating attribute values, as well as constraints such as equality, disequality, and inequality constraints. It also includes constraint propagation mechanisms for maintaining the consistency of constraints<sup><a href=\"https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/arxivcs/pdf/0506/0506005v1.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-01-03T02:11:44Z&st=2024-01-02T18:11:44Z&spr=https&sig=ngrEqvqBVaxyuSYqgPVeF%2B9c0fXLs94v3ASgwg7LDBs%3D\">source</a></sup>.\\n\\n3. **Recurrence with Affine Level Mappings in CLP(R):** This reference discusses a class of constraint logic programs such that their termination can be proved by using affine level mappings.

It provides a framework for a logic programming language that is parametrized with respect to constraint language and a domain of computation, yielding soundness and completeness results for an operational semantics relying on a constraint solver for the employed constraint language<sup><a href=\"https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/arxivcs/pdf/0008/0008036v1.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-01-03T02:11:44Z&st=2024-01-02T18:11:44Z&spr=https&sig=ngrEqvqBVaxyuSYqgPVeF%2B9c0fXLs94v3ASgwg7LDBs%3D\">source</a></sup>.\\n\\n2. **Constraint Logic Programming over Finite Domains (CLP(FD)):** This is an extension of logic programming where logical variables are assigned a domain and relations between variables are described with constraints. It provides primitives for accessing and updating attribute values, as well as constraints such as equality, disequality, and inequality constraints. It also includes constraint propagation mechanisms for maintaining the consistency of constraints<sup><a href=\"https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/arxivcs/pdf/0506/0506005v1.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-01-03T02:11:44Z&st=2024-01-02T18:11:44Z&spr=https&sig=ngrEqvqBVaxyuSYqgPVeF%2B9c0fXLs94v3ASgwg7LDBs%3D\">source</a></sup>.\\n\\n3. **Recurrence with Affine Level Mappings in CLP(R):** This reference discusses a class of constraint logic programs such that their termination can be proved by using affine level mappings.
