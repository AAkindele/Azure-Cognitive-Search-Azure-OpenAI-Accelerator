    "These are the pros and cons of using the Bot Service:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**:\n",
    "- Easy to connect to multiple channels, including O365 emails, MS Teams, web chat plugging, etc.\n",
    "- The Bot Framework python SDKs give us a lot of utilities like Typing indicator, pro-active messages, cards, file upload, etc. \n",
    "- Provides Authentication and logging mechanism without us to do much work\n",
    "- As other Microsoft Service, you get Microsoft product team and support teams behind it\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**:\n",
    "- It doesn't support streaming (yet)\n",
    "- Has a steeper learning curve to learn all its capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So, as an alternative, in this Notebook we are going to build another Backend API, this time using FastAPI with LangServe.\n",
    "From the [LANGSERVE DOCUMENTATION](https://python.langchain.com/docs/langserve):\n",
    "\n",
    "    LangServe helps developers deploy LangChain runnables and chains as a REST API.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This library is integrated with FastAPI and uses pydantic for data validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In addition, it provides a client that can be used to call into runnables deployed on a server. A JavaScript client is available in LangChain.js."

      "{\"output\":{\"output\":\"I have found multiple meanings and applications for the term \\\"CLP.\\\" Here are some of the contexts in which \\\"CLP\\\" is mentioned:\\n\\n1. **Constraint Logic Programming (CLP):** CLP is a powerful extension of conventional logic programming that incorporates constraint languages and constraint solving methods into logic programming languages. It involves the parametrization of a logic programming language with respect to a constraint language and a domain of computation, yielding soundness and completeness results for an operational semantics relying on a constraint solver for the employed constraint language<sup><a href=\\\"https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/arxivcs/pdf/0008/0008036v1.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-01-03T02:11:44Z&st=2024-01-02T18:11:44Z&spr=https&sig=ngrEqvqBVaxyuSYqgPVeF%2B9c0fXLs94v3ASgwg7LDBs%3D\\\">source</a></sup>.\\n\\n2. **Constraint Logic Programming (CLP(FD)):** CLP(FD) is an extension of logic programming where logical variables are assigned a domain, and relations between variables are described with constraints. It provides primitives for accessing and updating attribute values, as well as various types of constraints such as equality, disequality, and inequality constraints<sup><a href=\\\"https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/arxivcs/pdf/0506/0506005v1.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-01-03T02:11:44Z&st=2024-01-02T18:11:44Z&spr=https&sig=ngrEqvqBVaxyuSYqgPVeF%2B9c0fXLs94v3ASgwg7LDBs%3D\\\">source</a></sup>.\\n\\n3. **Core-Like Particles (CLP):** CLP can also stand for \\\"core-like particles\\\" in the context of virology and particle quantification. For example, in the study of bluetongue virus (BTV) core-like particles, immunosorbent electron microscopy was used to quantify recombinant baculovirus-generated BTV core-like particles in purified preparations or lysates of recombinant baculovirus-infected cells<sup><a href=\\\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10403670/?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-01-03T02:11:44Z&st=2024-01-02T18:11:44Z&spr=https&sig=ngrEqvqBVaxyuSYqgPVeF%2B9c0fXLs94v3ASgwg7LDBs%3D\\\">source</a></sup>.\\n\\n4. **Research and Technical Papers:** CLP is also mentioned in the context of research papers and technical notes related to constraint logic programming, termination analysis, and probabilistic constraint logic programming<sup><a href=\\\"https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/arxivcs/pdf/0508/0508108v1.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-01-03T02:11:44Z&st=2024-01-02T18:11:44Z&spr=https&sig=ngrEqvqBVaxyuSYqgPVeF%2B9c0fXLs94v3ASgwg7LDBs%3D\\\">source</a></sup>.\\n\\nIf you have a specific context in mind, please provide more details for a more targeted explanation.\"},\"callback_events\":[],\"metadata\":{\"run_id\":\"94822e2a-6fed-48d8-858b-bafee3104353\"}}\n"
