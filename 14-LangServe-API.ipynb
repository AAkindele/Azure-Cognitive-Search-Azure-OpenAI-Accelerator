    "These are the pros and cons of using the Bot Service:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**:\n",
    "- Easy to connect to multiple channels, including O365 emails, MS Teams, web chat plugging, etc.\n",
    "- The Bot Framework python SDKs give us a lot of utilities like Typing indicator, pro-active messages, cards, file upload, etc. \n",
    "- Provides Authentication and logging mechanism without us to do much work\n",
    "- It has SDKs for Python, JavaScript and .NET\n",
    "- Includes easy connection with Application Insights Service for app monitoring\n",
    "- As other Microsoft services, you get Microsoft product team and support teams behind it\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**:\n",
    "- It doesn't support streaming (yet)\n",
    "- It doesn't support private endpoint\n",
    "- Has a steeper learning curve to learn all its capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So, as an alternative, in this Notebook we are going to build another Backend API in the same Azure App Service, this time using FastAPI with LangServe.<br>\n",
    "From the [LANGSERVE DOCUMENTATION](https://python.langchain.com/docs/langserve):\n",
    "\n",
    "    LangServe helps developers deploy LangChain runnables and chains as a REST API.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This library is integrated with FastAPI and uses pydantic for data validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In addition, it provides a client that can be used to call into runnables deployed on a server. A JavaScript client is available in LangChain.js."

      "CLP can refer to different concepts depending on the context. Here are two definitions based on the documents provided:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Constraint Logic Programming (CLP)**: CLP is a form of logic programming that extends the traditional logic programming paradigm by incorporating constraints into the language. It combines the benefits of constraint satisfaction problem solving with logic programming's declarative nature. In CLP, constraints are used to restrict the possible values that variables can take, and a constraint solver is used to find values for the variables that satisfy all the constraints<sup><a href=\"https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/arxivcs/pdf/0508/0508108v1.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-01-03T02:11:44Z&st=2024-01-02T18:11:44Z&spr=https&sig=ngrEqvqBVaxyuSYqgPVeF%2B9c0fXLs94v3ASgwg7LDBs%3D\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a></sup>.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Chilean Peso (CLP)**: In the context of currency, CLP is the ISO 4217 currency code for the Chilean Peso, which is the official currency of Chile. The symbol for the Chilean Peso is $, and it is subdivided into 100 smaller units called centavos, although centavo coins are no longer in use<sup><a href=\"https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html\" target=\"_blank\">[2]</a></sup>.\n",
      "\n",
      "The specific meaning of CLP would depend on whether the context is related to computer science and programming, finance, or another field entirely. If you have a specific context in mind, please provide more details so that I can assist you further.\n",
